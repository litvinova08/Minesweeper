## Description of project (spec / MVP)

Recreate a simplified version of the game Minesweeper to be played in the java console. The game is able to randomly generate 10 mines in a 10x10 grid. The user is able to enter a command that represents a coordinate to check a location for a mine. The application will display a number from 0-8 depending on how many mines surround that location. If the user selects a mine, the game will respond "boom!" and the game will be lost. If every non-mine square has been revealed, the game is won. The grid is being rendered to the console after every user command

## Future Goals

- Store all revealed cells to manage scenarios when the user selects the same cell twice.
- Allow for the user to configure number of mines and grid size via a configuration.json file.
- Discovering an empty square should reveal all squares around it, and cascade into other nearby empty squares.
